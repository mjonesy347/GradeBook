# gradebook
First run in with C#, building a gradebook, this coude was provdied via pluralsight and the course instructor is Scott Allen.
This project provided me with the opportunity to become familar with C# and general syntax in C#. I learned about several concepts including .NET Core Frameworks, classes and objects, Unit tests, reference types and value types, jumping and switch statements, delegates, and OOP.
